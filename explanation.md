Step-by-Step Guide

1. Choose an Email Service Provider
-Use a service like Resend, SendGrid, or MailerSend that supports SMTP and provides APIs for sending emails with unsubscribe links. Resend is beginner-friendly and has a free tier (up to 3,000 emails/month), making it suitable for your 30 subscribers.
-Sign up for an account and obtain SMTP credentials (host, port, username, password) and an API key.

2.Configure Custom SMTP in Supabase
-Supabase’s default email system is for testing only and has strict rate limits (e.g., 4 emails/hour), so you need a custom SMTP setup for production.
-In your Supabase dashboard:
    :Go to Project Settings > Auth > SMTP Settings.
    :Toggle Enable Custom SMTP.
    :Enter the SMTP credentials from your email provider (e.g., Resend’s SMTP settings: smtp.resend.com, port 587, username resend, password is your API key).
    :Set a Sender Email (e.g., newsletter@yourdomain.com) and Sender Name (e.g., Your Brand).
    :Save the settings. Now Supabase Auth can send emails through your provider.
    
3.Set Up a Supabase Edge Function to Send Bulk Emails
-Edge Functions allow you to run serverless code to send emails programmatically. You’ll use this to fetch your 30 subscribers’ emails from Supabase and send a newsletter via your email provider’s API.
-In the Supabase dashboard:
    :Navigate to Edge Functions > Create a new function.
    :Choose the “Send Emails” template (as mentioned in a post on X) or create a custom function.

                                                          ______________________________________________

-Environment Variables:
    :Set SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and RESEND_API_KEY in the Edge Function settings (get these from your Supabase project and Resend dashboard).
    
-Notes:
    :Replace "users" with your actual Supabase table name.
    :Customize the html content for your newsletter.
    :The List-Unsubscribe and List-Unsubscribe-Post headers enable one-click unsubscribe, required by Gmail and Yahoo since February 2024.

4.Handle Unsubscribe Requests
-The unsubscribe link in the email (mailto:unsubscribe@yourdomain.com) sends an email to a dedicated address. Alternatively, use an HTTP link (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/unsubscribe?email={{email}}) that triggers another Edge Function to remove the user from your Supabase table.
